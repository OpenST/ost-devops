Currently Dynamodb tables are created at the end of contract deployment using the below commands
// Create tables in DynamoDB
node executables/ddb_related_data_migrations/create_init_ddb_tables.js
node executables/ddb_related_data_migrations/create_shards.js

1: Setup lambda after you have made dynamodb tables so that you can set dynamodb triggers

2: Create the function with the below name format
    ${env_platform}_saasApi_DDB_to_ES
    eg:] staging_4_saasApi_DDB_to_ES

3: Create triggers on Dynamodb transaction tables

4: Make sure you select correct vpc subnet and security group

5: Attach role (staging_2_saasApi_DDB_to_ES) to Lambda function

6: Verify after deployment that the env variables are currectly uploaded and that the function code is also uploaded


7 : Create role for Lambda and Dynamodb

Role: AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_DynamoDBTable (edited)
